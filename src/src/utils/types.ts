/**
 * Makes sure object extends a certain type
 *
 * @remarks
 * Call this function with a generic parameter of desired type.
 * The function returns another function which accepts an "as const" object.
 * If that object does not extend the type given specified the first function
 * a type error is thrown.
 *
 * The function has to return a function because typescript does not allow to
 * explicitly specify first generic, while leave the second implicit.
 *
 * The function is needed since `const value: SomeType = {...} as const;` would
 * cast the value to `SomeType` and lose the information from the `as const`
 * assertion.
 *
 * The disadvantage of this function is that "Go to definition" IDE feature
 * doesn't work as good when an `as const` object is wrapped in "ensure". For
 * use cases where that feature is important, instead of wrapping the
 * object in ensure, add an ensure line after object definition. A disadvantage
 * of not wrapping the object is that IDE won't be able to do autocompletion
 * inside the object from the type information and the type error, if present,
 * is going to be thrown at the "ensure" line, rather than in the exact place
 * inside the object where the error originated.
 *
 * @example Wrapping an `as const` object
 * ```ts
 * const tools = ensure<keoyf Tables>()(['CollectionObject','Locality'] as const);
 * ```
 *
 * @example Usage without wrapping
 * ```ts
 * const tools = ['CollectionObject', 'Locality'] as const;
 * ensure<RA<tools>>(tools);
 * ```
